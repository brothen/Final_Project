# A Spaceman, a Pirate, and a Cowboy Walk Into a Bar
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme
The theme "Reverse" was used by giving the player the ability to reverse gravity and had the levels get less crazy over time instead of more crazy by going from Space, to the ocean, to a desert

## Game Play
Get to the end of each level using your cool gravity flipping power and avoiding the enemies.

Use A and D to move left and right, W to jump, and G to flip gravity

## Impediments
Movement code had to be rewritten, like, four times to get the gravity flipping right.
Enemy code for the meteor had to be written like twice over.
tile mapping took forever to figure out

## References
The gravity flipping idea actually came from a reference to Jet Pack Joyride's gravity suit, we hope we implemented the strategy of that well.
Walking on the clouds in the Pirate level is a reference to the anime "One Piece"

## Future Development
No future development planned
