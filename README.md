# A Spaceman, a Pirate, and a Cowboy Walk Into a Bar
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme
We gave the player the ability to reverse gravity and had the levels get less crazy over time instead of more crazy

## Game Play
Get to the end of each level using your cool gravity flipping power

Use A and D to move left and right, W to jump, and G to flip gravity

## Impediments
Movement code had to be rewritten, like, four times to get the gravity flipping right.
